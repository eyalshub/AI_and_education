## üß≠ Overview

This architecture outlines an end-to-end pipeline for generating complete lessons and full courses using LLMs within an LMS environment. The design emphasizes modularity, scalability, pedagogical alignment, and teacher-friendly usability. All agents, document retrieval mechanisms, and content generation components are orchestrated to support both automated and feedback-driven workflows.

## üñºÔ∏è High-Level Architecture Diagram (Textual Description)

1. **User Input**  
   The teacher selects a **subject** and **grade level** to initiate the generation process.

2. **Expert Agents (Hybrid with SLM)**  
   Each subject and grade level is handled by a predefined **Expert Agent** ‚Äî a modular component responsible for injecting pedagogical and domain expertise into the content generation pipeline.
   
   **Agent Roles:**
   - **Subject Agent**: Encapsulates instructional conventions, domain terminology, and expected depth of knowledge per subject (e.g., Math, History, Physics).
   - **Grade Agent**: Adjusts tone, complexity, pacing, and format to match cognitive and developmental levels for the chosen grade.

3. **RAG Layer (Per Subject √ó Grade)**  
   - Pre-indexed vector database (e.g., Vertex AI Matching Engine) stores domain-specific documents.
   - Relevant documents are retrieved using semantic search based on concept similarity.

4. **Prompt Fusion**  
   The selected agents and RAG documents are combined to create a rich, structured prompt.

5. **LLM Execution**  
   The prompt is sent to the LLM (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro or Vertex AI) to generate:
   - Syllabus
   - Lesson plans
   - Learning objectives
   - Quiz questions & answers
   - Summary and supporting content

6. **Temporary Storage and Teacher Feedback**  
   The content is saved for a limited duration (~7 days).  
   Teachers can preview, download, or fork and edit the content.  
   Feedback is collected to improve future outputs.

## üß† Where Does the LLM Fit In?

The Large Language Model (LLM) plays a central role in content generation throughout the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:

- **Syllabus Generation**: Produces a sequence of lessons aligned with the selected subject and grade level.
- **Lesson Content Creation**: Generates explanations, learning objectives, topic summaries, and slide content.
- **Quiz Authoring**: Constructs multiple-choice and open-ended questions, including accurate answers and distractors.
- **Pedagogical Adaptation**: Modifies tone, complexity, and structure to align with grade-specific cognitive requirements.
- **Teacher Assistance (Optional)**: Supports post-generation tasks such as rephrasing, content expansion, and Q&A generation

## üóÉÔ∏è Database & Storage Architecture

The system uses a combination of **Firestore**, **Cloud Storage**, and **BigQuery** to handle structured data, large files, and analytical workloads.

---

### üî∏ Firestore (NoSQL)

Used for structured, real-time metadata and logs.

**Stores:**
- Lesson metadata (title, subject, grade level, creation date)
- Agent context (selected inputs, agent responses)
- Feedback and usage logs
- Generation state and retry counters (n, i)

**Why Firestore?**
- Fast, serverless NoSQL with real-time reads/writes
- TTL support (auto-deletion after 7 days)
- Hierarchical document model for clean querying

---

### üî∏ Cloud Storage

Used for storing generated artifacts and downloadable assets.

**Stores:**
- Generated files (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Slide decks and lesson exports
- Raw prompt-response pairs (for future audits or fine-tuning)

**Why Cloud Storage?**
- Handles large binary/text files
- Lifecycle rules for cleanup
- Scales easily with cost-effective cold storage options

---

### üîπ BigQuery

Used for scalable analytics and reporting on usage, performance, and quality trends.

**Stores:**
- Structured logs of generation attempts (success/failures, timing, retry counts)
- Aggregated feedback scores (per lesson, per teacher, per agent)
- Usage metrics (which subjects/grades are most common, teacher activity, trends)

**Rationale for Choosing BigQuery:**
- Supports massive-scale analytical workloads with SQL-like querying.
- Enables the creation of dashboards and reports using Looker Studio.
- Allows structured analysis of generation quality, feedback trends, and usage patterns.
- Provides a foundation for future enhancements such as A/B testing and model fine-tuning insights.


---

## üîó LMS Team Collaboration

To enable seamless integration between the content generation system and the LMS, the following capabilities are required from the LMS team:

### üìÑ Document Access for RAG
- Provide access to structured and unstructured instructional materials (e.g., textbooks, existing lesson plans, curriculum guides).
- Documents should be accessible via API or pre-indexed for retrieval.

### üîå APIs for Content Ingestion
- Expose endpoints that allow exporting or fetching instructional data.
- Metadata such as `subject`, `grade level`, `timestamp`, and `author` should be included for accurate tagging and processing.

### üîê Authentication Integration
- Implement OAuth2 or SSO mechanisms to support secure, role-based access control.
- Ensures proper authorization for teachers, reviewers, and administrators.

### üîî Webhooks for Content & Feedback Updates 
- Send real-time triggers when new content is uploaded or when feedback is submitted.
- Enables immediate regeneration or quality review cycles based on events.

## üîê Security Principles

### üìö Security Standards for Education & AI

This system adheres to widely recognized security and privacy protocols, especially relevant to AI in educational environments:

- **FERPA** ‚Äì Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (student data privacy)
- **COPPA** ‚Äì Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (age-appropriate data handling)
- **ISO/IEC 27001** ‚Äì Information security management standards

### üõ°Ô∏è Integrated Security Controls

Each security measure is applied at a specific stage of the pipeline, as illustrated below:

| Security Measure         | Description                                                                 | Integration Point                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege**      | Role-based IAM permissions for users and services                          | Firestore, Cloud Functions, RAG access, LLM calls           |

### ‚úÖ Summary

Security is enforced across the entire pipeline, from user authentication and content generation to storage and analytics. The architecture aligns with education-specific regulations and modern AI safety standards to ensure compliance, transparency, and user trust.

## üí° Additional Considerations

- **Scalability**  
  The system is built on stateless, event-driven services with autoscaling capabilities (e.g., Cloud Run or Cloud Functions). This ensures efficient performance under varying traffic loads, especially during peak school usage hours.

- **Cost Optimization**  
  Designed with minimal always-on components. All inference, data processing, and feedback handling are triggered on-demand. Temporary storage with TTL policies prevents unnecessary storage costs.

- **Analytics & Monitoring**  
  Logs and usage metrics are streamed to **BigQuery** for structured analysis. Visual dashboards (e.g., Looker Studio) provide visibility into:
  - Feedback quality
  - Popular subjects/grades
  - Agent performance
  - Retry/error rates

- **Post-MVP Enhancements**  
  Planned features for future releases:
  - ‚úÖ ‚ÄúFork & Edit‚Äù lesson authoring workflows for teachers
  - üìö Shared libraries of generated content across teacher teams
  - üéØ Fine-tuning expert agents based on teacher profiles or classroom data
  - üåç Native support for multilingual generation (e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish)
