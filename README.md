# üìò Part B: High-Level System Design ‚Äì Generating Full Lessons and Courses with AI

## üß≠ Overview

This architecture describes the end-to-end pipeline for generating entire lessons and full courses using LLMs within an LMS environment. The design prioritizes modularity, scalability, pedagogical fidelity, and teacher-centric usability. All agents, document retrieval, and content generation are structured to serve both automatic and feedback-based workflows.

## üñºÔ∏è High-Level Architecture Diagram (Textual Description)

1. **User Input**  
   The teacher selects a **subject** and a **grade level**.

2. **Expert Agents (Hybrid with SLM)**  
   Each subject and grade level is handled by a predefined **Expert Agent** ‚Äî a modular component responsible for injecting pedagogical and domain expertise into the content generation pipeline.

   **Agent Types:**
   - **Subject Agent**: Encodes pedagogical conventions, terminology, and depth expectations based on the subject (e.g., Math, History, Physics).
   - **Grade Agent**: Adjusts tone, language complexity, pacing, and format to match cognitive expectations for the target grade.

   **Hybrid Architecture:**
   - **Rule-Based Layer**: Hardcoded logic, templates, and domain-specific rules.
   - **SLM Layer (Small Language Model)**: Invoked for complex decisions (e.g., simplifying texts, adapting sensitive topics).

   This hybrid design ensures both **reliability** and **pedagogical finesse**, allowing agents to act as true experts rather than static templates.

3. **RAG Layer (Per Subject √ó Grade)**  
   - Pre-indexed vector database (e.g., Vertex AI Matching Engine) stores domain-specific documents.
   - Relevant documents are retrieved using semantic search based on concept similarity.

4. **Prompt Fusion**  
   The selected agents and RAG documents are combined to create a rich, structured prompt.

5. **LLM Execution**  
   The prompt is sent to the LLM (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro or Vertex AI) to generate:
   - Syllabus
   - Lesson plans
   - Learning objectives
   - Quiz questions & answers
   - Summary and supporting content

6. **Temporary Storage and Teacher Feedback**  
   The content is saved for a limited duration (~7 days).  
   Teachers can preview, download, or fork and edit the content.  
   Feedback is collected to improve future outputs.

## üß† Where Does the LLM Fit In?

- **Syllabus Generation**: Generates a sequence of lessons based on subject and grade.
- **Lesson Content**: Produces explanations, objectives, summaries, slides.
- **Quiz Generation**: Creates multiple choice and open-ended questions with answers.
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts tone, complexity, and structure based on grade-level input.
- **Teacher Support (Optional)**: Enables Q&A or ‚Äúrewrite this‚Äù capabilities in post-generation flow.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Choice

- **Firestore (NoSQL)**  
  Stores:
  - Metadata for lessons
  - Agent input context
  - Feedback and usage logs  
  Features:
  - TTL for auto-deletion  
  - Hierarchical and scalable document structure

- **Cloud Storage**  
  Stores:
  - Generated files (PDFs, DOCX, HTML)  
  - Slide decks and exports  
  Features:
  - Lifecycle rules for deletion
  - Integration with Firestore metadata

- *(Optional)* **BigQuery** for analytics at scale

---

## üîó LMS Team Collaboration

The LMS must provide:

- **Document Access for RAG**  
  Structured and unstructured instructional content (e.g., textbooks, lesson plans).

- **APIs for Content Ingestion**  
  Export or fetch endpoints with subject/grade tags, timestamps, and content metadata.

- **Authentication Integration**  
  OAuth2 or SSO for role-based access and secure identification of users.

- **(Optional) Webhooks for Updates**  
  Triggered when new content is created or feedback is submitted.

| Component              | GCP Service                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| LLM Execution          | Vertex AI / Gemini 1.5               |
| Logic & Orchestration  | Cloud Run                            |
| Event Triggers         | Cloud Functions                      |
| Metadata Storage       | Firestore                            |
| File Storage           | Cloud Storage                        |
| RAG Search Engine      | Vertex AI Matching Engine (optional) |
| Secrets Management     | Secret Manager                       |
| Monitoring & Logging   | Cloud Logging + Operations Suite     |

## üîê Security Principles

- **Least Privilege**  
  Fine-grained IAM roles for services and users.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  OAuth2 / SSO integration with the LMS.

- **TTL & Cleanup**  
  Temporary files auto-expire after a set retention period.

- **Secret Isolation**  
  API keys managed via Secret Manager with scoped access.

- **Encryption**  
  All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

- **Audit Logging**  
  All major actions (generation, fork, feedback) are logged.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limits to prevent misuse of generation APIs.

---

## üí° Additional Considerations

- **Scalability**  
  Stateless services with auto-scaling ensure support for heavy traffic.

- **Cost Optimization**  
  Event-driven design, temporary storage, and minimal inference overhead.

- **Analytics & Monitoring**  
  Leverage BigQuery or Looker Studio for insights into usage trends and feedback quality.

- **Post-MVP Enhancements**  
  - ‚ÄúFork & Edit‚Äù lesson workflows  
  - Shared libraries and team dashboards  
  - Agent fine-tuning per class/team  
  - Multi-language support
